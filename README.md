# Discordify
Spicetify theme to make your Spotify look like Discord

## Installation
Prerequisite: Make sure you already have [Spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli/) installed before applying this theme

1. Go to your Spicetify installation folder, and navigate to the themes folder.
2. Clone the following repository into the themes folder, using `git clone https://github.com/lewdkouhai/Discordify.git`
3. This theme requires the Whitney font, which is what Discord uses. If you decide to continue without installing this font, it will resort to Sans-serif.
4. To set your theme to Discordify, type `spicetify config current_theme Discordify`
5. Just to make sure it's all set, type `spicetify update` and relaunch your Spotify.

### Themes
If you ever want to switch themes, you can just type `spicetify config color_scheme Light` for example.

The currently available themes are `Dark`, `Light`.

#### Beta Themes
- `AMOLED` is based on Discord's Android AMOLED experimental theme.
- `Darker` is based on a hidden Discord build override that makes dark theme darker.
- `Revamp` is based on Discord's website, and the custom [Discord-Revamp](https://github.com/LuckFire/Discord-Revamp) theme.

## Contributing
It's my first time making a theme for Spicetify so if you find anything that's a bit off or you'd like to theme any missing areas, feel free to submit a PR!
